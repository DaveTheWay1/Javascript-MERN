<!-- In the provided code, there's a fetch call made to the PokeAPI 
    to retrieve information about Pokémon. Let's break down the process 
    step by step:

fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon"): This initiates an HTTP 
request to the specified URL (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon) to 
fetch data from the PokeAPI. It returns a Promise that resolves to 
the entire HTTP response.

.then(response => { return response.json(); }): This is a Promise 
chain that operates on the response received from the API call. 
The response.json() method parses the response body as JSON and r
eturns a Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.

.then(response => { console.log(response); }): This is another 
.then() block chained to the previous one. Here, response 
represents the parsed JSON data from the API response body. 
In this example, it logs the parsed JSON data to the console.

.catch(err => { console.log(err); }): This .catch() block 
catches any errors that might occur during the execution of 
the promises, logging them to the console.

Explanation:

The first .then() is used to handle the initial HTTP response from the API.
The second .then() processes the HTTP response, parsing it as JSON. 
This step is necessary because the initial response from fetch might 
not directly contain the JSON data, but rather the entire HTTP response, 
including headers and other metadata.
The third .then() block logs the parsed JSON data, which would contain
information about Pokémon in this case.
The .catch() block captures any errors that might occur during the
process, such as network issues, server errors, or issues related to 
parsing the response.
In summary, the sequence of .then() blocks in the Promise chain 
allows you to handle different stages of the asynchronous process: 
receiving the HTTP response, parsing it as JSON, and handling any 
errors that might occur along the way. -->
