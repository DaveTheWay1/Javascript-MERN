There are a few key things to keep in mind about React's synthetic event system:

1. The event names are instead camelCased vs lowercase (i.e "onclick" becomes "onClick")
2. Returning false will not work with any event to prevent default browser behaviors (like refreshing a page or "bubbling" the event). You will need to manually callevent.stopPropagation() or event.preventDefault()as necessary.
3. Events cannot be called asynchronously because of how React "pools" the Synthetic events
